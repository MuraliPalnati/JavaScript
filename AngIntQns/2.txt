Forms in angular :
1. Template Driven (simple)
2. Model/Reactive Driven (complex)

In the json created the name field value will be the property and the [()] will the value
[(ngModel)] ="fullName" in html .ts fullName : string must be there in both

If we dont have the type="button" it will behave as submit, and submit methods are called.
By default angular will append , 'novalidate' to the <form>. hence all the validations like required,max would not work
if we place 'ngNativeValidate' would work as expected.
exporting the ngModel to the local template reference variable #fullNameControl="ngModel" and the complete form we use #myForm="ngForm"

touched,untouched,pristine,dirty,valid,invalid

The only difference between two is that value is always string, where in ngValue you can pass object
ngModeGroup password and confirmpassword single group.
