Forms in angular :
1. Template Driven (simple)
2. Model/Reactive Driven (complex)

In the json created the name field value will be the property and the [()] will the value > key :value 
[(ngModel)] ="fullName" in html, .ts fullName :string ='' > must be there in both else undefined error.

If we dont have the type="button" it will behave as submit, and submit methods are called.
By default angular will append , 'novalidate' to the <form>. hence all the validations like required,max would not work if we place 'ngNativeValidate' would work as expected.
exporting the ngModel to the local template reference variable #fullNameControl="ngModel" and the complete form we use #myForm="ngForm"
touched,untouched,pristine,dirty,valid,invalid

Route params : /people/:id   optional> /people/{id:emploee.id}
this.selectedEmployeeId = +this._route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id'); getting by id.
to get from the route param we use 'paramMap' and to get the details from the query we use 'queryParamMap' 
snapshot the route parameter value does not change and we want to read the initial route parameter value.
observable is when the route parameter changes and we want to react to the execute some code in response to the change.
when we subscribe we need to explicitly need to unsubscribe, ActivatedRoute it will automatically unsubscribe.
