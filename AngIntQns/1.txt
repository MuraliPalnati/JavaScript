// passes data from class to the html.

Interpolation>  from class to template(html) {{}}
property binding <img [src]=''/> or bind-disabled=''
attribute binding [attr-colspan]='' or attr.colspan="{{}}"

using property binding we can achieve only one property.
[ngClass]> this add multiple class bindings. css properties
[ngStyle]> can write a method to apply multiple styles. like : fontWeight


// Here passes data from html to the class
Event binding: 
(click)=''

//Two way data binding
[(ngModel)]

concatinate strings use Interpolation over property binding. property binding like button disabled use property binding.
angular bindings work with properties and events but not with attributes(key and value pairs).
