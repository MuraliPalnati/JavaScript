Interpolation>  from class to template(html) {{}}
property binding <img [src]=''/> or bind-disabled=''
attribute binding [attr-colspan]='' or attr.colspan="{{}}"

concatinate strings use Interpolation over property binding. property binding like button disabled use property binding.
angular bindings work with properties and events but not with attributes(key and value pairs).
